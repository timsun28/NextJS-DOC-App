This app can be used as a start for your personal DOC Walking tracks collection.

The data in the doc_tracks.json files has been collected through the [DOC API](https://api.doc.govt.nz/) on 29-5-2020. 
The json file is displayed in a AG Grid React Table with a detail panel with more information. 

This app can be used as a great start for anyone who wants to create and personalise their own DOC Walking tracks app.

Because the json file is static this app is hosted on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/) for free and can be saved on your device because of the Progressive Web App functionalities to use it when you're hiking and offline.
